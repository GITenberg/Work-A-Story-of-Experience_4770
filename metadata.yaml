description: "Work: A Story of Experience, first published in 1873, is a semi-autobiographical\
  \ novel by Louisa May Alcott, the author of Little Women, set in the times before\
  \ and after the American Civil War.\nIt is one of \"several nineteenth-century novels\
  \ [which] uncovers the changes in women's work in the new industrial era, as well\
  \ as the dilemmas, tensions, and the meaning of that work\". The story depicts the\
  \ struggles of a young woman trying to support herself. The main character, Christie\
  \ Devon, works outside the home in a variety of different jobs, but the end of her\
  \ story marks \"the beginning of a new career as a voice and activist for other\
  \ working women\".\nThe character David Sterling is loosely based on Alcott's friend,\
  \ Henry David Thoreau.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
